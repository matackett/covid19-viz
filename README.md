"In just 15 days the total number of #COVID19 cases in Georgia is up 49%, but you wouldn’t know it from looking at the state’s data visualization map of cases. The first map is July 2. The second is today. Do you see a 50% case increase? Can you spot how they’re hiding it?"

"After adjusting for potential confounders, for each g/day increase in consumption of head cabbage of the country, the mortality risk for COVID-19 decreases by 13.6 %. For each g/day increase in consumption of cucumber, the mortality risk decreases by 15.7%. Consumption of lettuce and broccoli showed the opposite pattern, i.e. a higher consumption was associated with a higher COVID-19 mortality. However, the results were more sensitive to adjustment, and the associations were no longer significant in some of the models."
